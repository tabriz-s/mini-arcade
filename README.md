# üïπÔ∏è Cozy Arcade

Welcome to **Cozy Arcade**, a little website filled with mini-games made to help you slow down, unwind, and enjoy wasting your time.

This is a personal project I‚Äôm building slowly, piece by piece. It's both a learning space and a creative outlet, and over time I hope it becomes a collection of joyful and relaxing games.

## What is Cozy Arcade?

**Cozy Arcade** is a small web app made with React. Think of it as a digital arcade, but instead of flashing lights and chaos, it leans into soft visuals, gentle animations, and calming vibes. It'll eventually have:

- Five unique minigames, each designed like a little level
- A welcoming home screen that also tracks your progress
- Responsive design so it feels good on any screen

## How to Run It

Here‚Äôs how to try it out on your computer:

### 1. Clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cozy-arcade.git

### 2. Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

It should open up in your browser.
