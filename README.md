# 🕹️ Cozy Arcade

Welcome to **Cozy Arcade**, a little corner of the web filled with mini-games made to help you slow down, unwind, and enjoy wasting your time.

This is a personal project I’m building slowly, piece by piece. It's both a learning space and a creative outlet, and over time I hope it becomes a collection of joyful and relaxing games.

## ✨ What is Cozy Arcade?

**Cozy Arcade** is a small web app made with React. Think of it as a digital arcade, but instead of flashing lights and chaos, it leans into soft visuals, gentle animations, and calming vibes. It'll eventually have:

- 🌼 Five unique minigames, each designed like a little "level"
- 🎮 A home screen that welcomes you in and tracks your progress
- 💻 Responsive design so it feels good on any screen
- 🧊 Aesthetic touches like glitchy title effects and smooth transitions

## 🚀 How to Run It

If you’re new to React, here’s how to try it out on your computer:

### 1. Clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cozy-arcade.git
cd cozy-arcade
```
### 2. Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash

It should open up in your browser.
